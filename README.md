### Hi there 👋 I'm Lilian G. (aka N3ROO on github)

- 🔨 Currently working on [Bettercolors](https://github.com/N3ROO/Bettercolors) 7.0.0, [BettercolorsEngine](https://github.com/N3ROO/BettercolorsEngine) 0.3.0, [LatencyMod](https://github.com/N3ROO/LatencyMod) 1.0.0, and [AimAssistanceMod](https://github.com/N3ROO/AimAssistanceMod) 1.0.0. They're all minecraft mods.
- 💡 It could be fun to develop an anti-cheat Minecraft plugin that prevents reach hacks
- 📚 I’ve got some experience every domain on computer science. Lately, I've been studying reverse engineering and C++ (in depth). I update a C++ cheatsheet during the process. (accessible on my [website](https://nero.dev/cpp))
